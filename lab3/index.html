	<p>We chose Connect 4 for our Problem Solving game. We thought this game would be a good fit for the steps needed to pseudocode. The game consists of constant moves that need to be repeated in order to reach the outcome of  connecting 4 in a row. In this game, it is necessary to keep track of your own moves as well ast the other players. This can be done visualy as well as mentally. For example, one can see that they placed a piece in the column, ot they can take a mental note.</p>

	<h2>What actions can I take?</h2>
	<p>Actions required for this task are placing chips, colored, or marked pieces in
7x6 grid. The end goal is to place 4 pieces together in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</p><br>
<h2>What do I need to remember or keep track of?</h2>
<p>It is necessary to remember to keep track of your past moves, and how it will affect your future ones. You also have to keep track of the opponents moves, as it will alter your moves, as well as the opponents.</p><br>
<h2>What do I do over and over again?</h2>
<p>An action that is done over and over again is the placement of each piece. This is the action that will determine the outcome of the game, or in other words, the “solution” to the problem.</p><br>
<h2>When do I need to make decisions?</h2>
<p>Decisions are made up until one of the two players or users connects 4 pieces or the grid is full and no empty spaces remain.</p><br>
<h2>Psuedo-Code</h2>
<p>One person starts by placing a piece anywhere on the grid, and repeats by taking turns.
	If player A has not connected 4 pieces, then player B gets a turn.
	If player B has not connected 4 pieces, then player A gets a turn.
Stop once either player has connected 4 consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
