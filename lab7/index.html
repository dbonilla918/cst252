                <p>We didn't encounter too many major challenges for this lab, if anything the hardest part was just us figuring out a way to write out to code.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>Problems:</h2><br>
                <p>Just like the challenges portion says, we didnt encounter many problems thankfully. This lab was much easier than the last one and didnt give us much trouble or caused too much stress.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h2>Results:</h2><br>
                <p>We were able to make the lab work and created two different functions that get called with different parameters.</p>
